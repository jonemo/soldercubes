Soldercubes Experiment Substrate
================================

The experiment substrate is a grid of tiles whose surface resembles that of a Soldercube module including a soldering connector. This means, that Soldercubes can connect to substrate tiles allowing Soldercube assemblies to "walk" over the substrate.
