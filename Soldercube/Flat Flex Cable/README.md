Flat Flex Connector Cable
=========================

The Flat Flex Cable (FFC) connects the six [Soldering Connectors](../../Soldering Connector) to the [main controller PCB](../Main Controller Circuit Board) inside the Soldercube module. Depending on your vendor, you might be able to spec these out by simply stating the length and number of conductors. The supplier I chose wanted a full set of circuit board design files.

### File Description

 * `FlatFlexCable.brd`
 * `DFM Files` A folder of Gerber files exported from the `.brd` file together with a `readme.txt` that repeats all the information from the drawing.
