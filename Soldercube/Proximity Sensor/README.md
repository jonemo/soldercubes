Proximity Sensor
================

The proximity sensor is the small round printed circuit board (PCB) embedded in the outer shell of Soldercube modules. Different module types can house different numbers of proximity sensors: Actuated modules have space for four, all others have space for six.

The proximity sensor was a late addition to the module design and as such isn't as well embedded in the design as the other components. Connecting the proximity sensors to the main controller PCB requires making and soldering three cables per sensor. If your goal is to assemble your first Soldercube module with as little effort as possible, you might want to consider leaving the proximity sensors out for now.
