Soldercube Solidworks Models
============================

The files in this folder and its subfolders were used to develop the mechanical design of the Soldercube module types. All components including fabricated and purchased ones but excluding wires and fasteners are represented in these files. The level of detail varies depending on the type of object modeled: Purchased parts are only modeled to the level of detail required for modelling the assembly, while 3d printed parts for example are modeled such that they can be fabricated from the model.

All files in this folder were generated with Solidworks 2010 Service Pack 2.1 (64bit edition) and are saved in Solidwork's native file formats `.sldprt` and `.sldasm`. You will not be able to open these files with older versions of Solidworks. [eDrawings Viewer](http://www.edrawingsviewer.com/ed/solidworks-viewer.htm) is a free software for Windows and MacOS X that allows viewing (but not editing) Solidworks files.
